## Overview
The Personal Workday Scheduler is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

### The challenge

The Personal Workday Scheduler runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. The Scheduler has a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

### User Story

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

### Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

## My process

I first broke the problem down into smaller sections of code. CSS was first, I worked with what was prewritten, modifying it, and adding icons with fontawesome.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Javascript
- jQuery
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

Blocks of code:

```js
```

```css
```


### Continued development

## Acknowledgments

A huge shout out to [nullaus](https://github.com/nullaus) who was my quick dial on all the random questions about JS, and taught me that the arguments of functions could call on variables inside of other functions.
